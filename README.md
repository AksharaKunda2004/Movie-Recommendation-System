# Movie-Recommendation-System
Project Description 
The goal is to develop a movie recommendation system using GUI. The system allows users to load a dataset of movies, preprocess the data, and train machine learning models to recommend movies based on genre. Recommendations are made using an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier that ranks movies by considering their genre, release year, and duration. The model utilizes a dataset of different movies in different genre.
